Made with:
 - Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Git

Description:

 - Remade my portfolio with Next.js (previously built with React) so that it is easier to maintain and update.

Future Updates:

- Will add MondoDB database so that I can store the contents for each project remotely
- I can then use TanStack Query to fetch the data for my projects
-
